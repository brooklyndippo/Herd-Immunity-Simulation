1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate,  reproductive rate)
1. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
1.  What percentage of the population died from the virus?
1.  Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?

*When you have answered these questions, please put your answers in a file called 'answers.txt' and commit this to your repo.

**Your repo should contain:**

* At least 1 log file generated from running your simulation.
* `simulation_test.py` file should be created that allows for testing the simulation.
* `logger_test.py` file should be created that allows for the testing of the logger class.
* Answers to the questions asked above listed in a file named `answers.txt`.
